# Open-World Necromancer

Build an **Open-World Necromancer** game in Godot 4 at `/workspace/game/`.
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player is a necromancer wandering a dark fantasy world, raising the dead from
fallen enemies to build an ever-growing undead army. The fantasy is forbidden
power: every battlefield becomes a recruitment ground, every graveyard a goldmine.
Tension comes from hero NPCs who hunt you — paladins, witch-hunters, and
adventuring parties that grow stronger as your infamy rises. You must conquer
territory, fortify positions with undead garrisons, and choose which minions to
raise based on the corpses available.

## What the Player Experiences

1. **Title Screen** — A dark, atmospheric title with the game name in gothic
   lettering over a misty graveyard scene. A play button pulses with eerie light.
2. **The World** — The player moves freely across a dark open world with villages,
   graveyards, forests, and ruined keeps. Each area has different enemy types and
   corpse quality.
3. **Combat** — Enemies (guards, militia, wildlife) attack on sight. The player
   has a dark magic attack and commands their undead minions to fight. Combat is
   real-time with simple click-to-attack and ability hotkeys.
4. **Raising the Dead** — After enemies fall, their corpses remain on the ground.
   The player channels a raise spell on corpses to add them to their army. Different
   corpse types yield different undead: skeleton warriors, zombie brutes, spectral
   archers.
5. **Army Management** — A minion panel shows the current army composition, health,
   and count. The player can dismiss weak undead to make room for stronger ones.
   Army size is capped by the player's necromantic power level.
6. **Territory Conquest** — Capturing a village or keep turns it into a dark
   stronghold. Garrisoned undead defend it. Conquered territory generates soul
   energy over time.
7. **Hero Hunters** — As infamy grows, hero NPCs spawn and hunt the player. They
   are powerful, have unique abilities, and require strategy to defeat. Defeating
   them yields elite corpses.

## Assets

2D assets are mounted read-only at:

- `/workspace/assets/library/` — Kenney CC0 packs (sprites, tiles, UI, fonts).
- `/workspace/assets/library-oga/` — OpenGameArt entries; respect each
  subdir's `LICENSE.txt`.

Browse the library and choose packs.
Copy what you need into your project's `assets/` folder.

## Project layout

```
/workspace/game/
  project.godot
  Main.tscn
  demo_outputs/    ← your input traces (1–10 files)
  scripts/  scenes/  assets/
```

The build must launch cleanly with:

```
godot --headless --path /workspace/game --quit-after 5
```

A reference for Godot CLI flags is at `/workspace/tools/godot_command_line.md`.
**Engine flags like `--headless` and `--quit-after N` must come BEFORE `--`** —
anything after `--` is forwarded to the project as user args and silently
ignored by the engine. Correct shape:
`godot --headless --quit-after 5 --path . -- --scenario near_victory`.

A screenshot helper is available at `/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh`. Use it to actually see what your UI / battlefield /
result screens look like.

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/frame.png --frames 60
```

To screenshot a specific scenario, append `--scenario <id>` after `--`. The
helper consumes only `--out` / `--frames` / `--scene`; remaining args stay in
`OS.get_cmdline_user_args()` for your game code to read. Example:

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/battle_debug.png --frames 120 --scenario battle
```

## Demos

Ship **1–10 input-trace files** under `/workspace/game/demo_outputs/`, one per
demo, each named `*.json`. The evaluator launches a fresh game per trace,
replays your trace as synthetic mouse and keyboard input at 1280×720, and
records the screen. Only the first 10 traces by filename are evaluated;
recordings longer than 20 s are sampled from a random 20 s window.

### Scenarios

Normal play should start from the title screen and demonstrate the task's
core gameplay loop.
Demo playback must be deterministic. For demos that need a specific state
(a specific level, combat state, upgrade screen, result state, or late-game
setup), define named scenarios your game loads when launched with:

```
godot --path /workspace/game -- --scenario <id>
```

When `--scenario <id>` is present the game must skip menus, set up the named
state deterministically (seed any RNG), and begin accepting input immediately.

### Trace file format

```json
{
  "scenario": "title_flow",
  "duration_frames": 360,
  "events": [
    {"frame": 30,  "type": "mouse_click", "button": "left", "x": 300, "y": 360},
    {"frame": 90,  "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "1"},
    {"frame": 180, "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "SPACE"},
    {"frame": 300, "type": "wait"}
  ]
}
```

- `scenario` — optional; omit for a normal game launch from the title screen.
- `duration_frames` — total frames to record at 30 fps; cap at **600 (20 s)**.
- `events` — time-ordered inputs. Coordinates are pixels in the 1280×720
  viewport. Supported types:
  - `mouse_click`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}`
  - `mouse_down` / `mouse_up`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}` —
    use these for drag interactions: emit `mouse_down` at the start point,
    one or more `mouse_move` events along the way, and `mouse_up` at the end.
    A `mouse_click` is a `mouse_down` + `mouse_up` at the same point in tight
    succession.
  - `mouse_move`: `{frame, type, x, y}`
  - `key_press` / `key_down` / `key_up`: `{frame, type, keycode}` — keycodes:
    `A`–`Z`, `0`–`9`, `ESCAPE`, `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, `BACKSPACE`,
    `DELETE`, `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.
  - `wait`: `{frame, type}` — anchor frame, no input.

Replay must be deterministic: same trace, fresh launch, same outcome every time.
