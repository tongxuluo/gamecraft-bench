# Strategy: Skirmish

Build a **dark-fantasy tactical skirmish** in Godot 4 at `/workspace/game/`.
This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable micro-game** that could
sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical slice.

## Core Vision

The player commands a small, outnumbered squad through desperate grid-based
battles where every move is a commitment and every loss is permanent for the
fight. The fantasy is **grim tactical survival** — a handful of specialists
against a tide of enemies, where positioning is life and a single misread costs
a unit you cannot replace mid-battle. The tone channels *Into the Breach* meets
*Darkest Dungeon* at a smaller scale: limited palette, high contrast, tense
decisions. The best version makes the player feel like a cornered general
finding the one sequence of moves that turns impossible odds into a narrow
victory.

## What the Player Experiences

A moody title screen sets the dark-fantasy tone immediately. The player begins
and receives a brief tactical briefing — the squad's objective, the threat
ahead, the stakes — before the grid appears.

The battle is turn-based and deliberate. The player selects a unit, sees its
limited movement range light up on the grid, and commits it to a position.
Enemies are visible, aggressive, and numerous — the squad is always
outnumbered. After the player spends their actions, an End Turn command hands
control to the enemy, which advances with purpose: flanking, closing distance,
attacking when in range. Then control returns and the cycle repeats.

Combat is lethal and readable. Attacks require proximity or a clear range
indicator, reduce persistent HP, and kill. Dead units vanish from the board and
stop blocking or threatening. The player's squad members are specialists —
different movement ranges, attack patterns, HP pools, or abilities — so
choosing who moves where and who attacks what is the core decision space.

The battlefield itself adds tactical texture: terrain obstacles funnel movement,
hazards punish careless positioning, or objectives create time pressure beyond
simple elimination. Multiple battle layouts keep the experience from feeling
solved after one fight.

Victory comes from eliminating all enemies; defeat from losing the squad. Either
outcome lands on a styled result screen showing what happened, and the player
can retry or return to the title without relaunching. The entire arc — title,
briefing, battle, result — flows as one continuous authored experience.

## Assets

2D assets are mounted read-only at:

- `/workspace/assets/library/` — Kenney CC0 packs (sprites, tiles, UI, fonts).
- `/workspace/assets/library-oga/` — OpenGameArt entries; respect each
  subdir's `LICENSE.txt`.

Browse the library and choose packs.
Copy what you need into your project's `assets/` folder.

## Project layout

```
/workspace/game/
  project.godot
  Main.tscn
  demo_outputs/    ← your input traces (1–10 files)
  scripts/  scenes/  assets/
```

The build must launch cleanly with:

```
godot --headless --path /workspace/game --quit-after 5
```

A reference for Godot CLI flags is at `/workspace/tools/godot_command_line.md`.
**Engine flags like `--headless` and `--quit-after N` must come BEFORE `--`** —
anything after `--` is forwarded to the project as user args and silently
ignored by the engine. Correct shape:
`godot --headless --quit-after 5 --path . -- --scenario near_victory`.

A screenshot helper is available at `/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh`. Use it to actually see what your UI / battlefield /
result screens look like.

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/frame.png --frames 60
```

To screenshot a specific scenario, append `--scenario <id>` after `--`. The
helper consumes only `--out` / `--frames` / `--scene`; remaining args stay in
`OS.get_cmdline_user_args()` for your game code to read. Example:

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/battle_debug.png --frames 120 --scenario battle
```

## Demos

Ship **1–10 input-trace files** under `/workspace/game/demo_outputs/`, one per
demo, each named `*.json`. The evaluator launches a fresh game per trace,
replays your trace as synthetic mouse and keyboard input at 1280×720, and
records the screen. Only the first 10 traces by filename are evaluated;
recordings longer than 20 s are sampled from a random 20 s window.

### Scenarios

Normal play should start from the title screen and demonstrate the task's
core gameplay loop.
Demo playback must be deterministic. For demos that need a specific state
(a specific level, combat state, upgrade screen, result state, or late-game
setup), define named scenarios your game loads when launched with:

```
godot --path /workspace/game -- --scenario <id>
```

When `--scenario <id>` is present the game must skip menus, set up the named
state deterministically (seed any RNG), and begin accepting input immediately.

### Trace file format

```json
{
  "scenario": "title_flow",
  "duration_frames": 360,
  "events": [
    {"frame": 30,  "type": "mouse_click", "button": "left", "x": 300, "y": 360},
    {"frame": 90,  "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "1"},
    {"frame": 180, "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "SPACE"},
    {"frame": 300, "type": "wait"}
  ]
}
```

- `scenario` — optional; omit for a normal game launch from the title screen.
- `duration_frames` — total frames to record at 30 fps; cap at **600 (20 s)**.
- `events` — time-ordered inputs. Coordinates are pixels in the 1280×720
  viewport. Supported types:
  - `mouse_click`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}`
  - `mouse_down` / `mouse_up`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}` —
    use these for drag interactions: emit `mouse_down` at the start point,
    one or more `mouse_move` events along the way, and `mouse_up` at the end.
    A `mouse_click` is a `mouse_down` + `mouse_up` at the same point in tight
    succession.
  - `mouse_move`: `{frame, type, x, y}`
  - `key_press` / `key_down` / `key_up`: `{frame, type, keycode}` — keycodes:
    `A`–`Z`, `0`–`9`, `ESCAPE`, `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, `BACKSPACE`,
    `DELETE`, `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.
  - `wait`: `{frame, type}` — anchor frame, no input.

Replay must be deterministic: same trace, fresh launch, same outcome every time.
