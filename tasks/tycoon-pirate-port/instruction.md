# Pirate Port

Build **Pirate Port**, a **pirate haven management tycoon game** in Godot 4 at
`/workspace/game/`. This is not a prototype. It is a **complete, shippable
micro-game** that could sit on an itch.io page or Steam as a polished vertical
slice.

## Core Vision

The player builds a hidden pirate port on a tropical island, attracting crews
with taverns and docks, sending them on raids for plunder, and defending
against the royal navy when notoriety grows too high. The economy loops through
three currencies: gold from raids funds buildings, reputation attracts better
crews, and notoriety draws navy attention. The tension is that the most
profitable actions raise notoriety fastest, forcing the player to balance
aggression against defense preparation. The tone is swashbuckling Caribbean:
palm trees, rickety docks, rum barrels, and cannon smoke.

## What the Player Experiences

From the title screen the player starts a new port. The view shows a coastal
island with a grid for building. The player constructs docks to berth ships,
taverns to attract pirate crews, warehouses to store plunder, and defenses
(walls, cannons, watchtowers) to repel navy raids.

Pirate crews arrive based on the port's reputation. Each crew has a ship type,
combat strength, and upkeep cost. The player sends crews on raids by selecting
a target from a map of trade routes — richer targets yield more gold but raise
notoriety higher. Raids play out automatically with a result summary.

Gold funds expansion: better docks attract larger ships, upgraded taverns keep
crews happy, and a shipyard allows repairing and upgrading vessels. Crew morale
depends on tavern quality, raid success, and pay.

When notoriety reaches thresholds, the navy attacks. Navy raids are tower-
defense encounters where the port's cannons and walls must hold against
incoming warships. Surviving a raid lowers notoriety slightly; failing means
losing buildings and crews.

The game tracks gold, fleet size, and raids completed. A styled result screen
shows port statistics when the port falls or reaches a prosperity milestone.

## Assets

2D assets are mounted read-only at:

- `/workspace/assets/library/` — Kenney CC0 packs (sprites, tiles, UI, fonts).
- `/workspace/assets/library-oga/` — OpenGameArt entries; respect each
  subdir's `LICENSE.txt`.

Browse the library and choose packs.
Copy what you need into your project's `assets/` folder.

## Project layout

```
/workspace/game/
  project.godot
  Main.tscn
  demo_outputs/    <- your input traces (1-10 files)
  scripts/  scenes/  assets/
```

The build must launch cleanly with:

```
godot --headless --path /workspace/game --quit-after 5
```

A reference for Godot CLI flags is at `/workspace/tools/godot_command_line.md`.
**Engine flags like `--headless` and `--quit-after N` must come BEFORE `--`** —
anything after `--` is forwarded to the project as user args and silently
ignored by the engine. Correct shape:
`godot --headless --quit-after 5 --path . -- --scenario near_victory`.

A screenshot helper is available at `/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh`. Use it to actually see what your UI / battlefield /
result screens look like.

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/frame.png --frames 60
```

To screenshot a specific scenario, append `--scenario <id>` after `--`. The
helper consumes only `--out` / `--frames` / `--scene`; remaining args stay in
`OS.get_cmdline_user_args()` for your game code to read. Example:

```
/workspace/tools/screenshot.sh --path /workspace/game \
      -- --out /workspace/battle_debug.png --frames 120 --scenario battle
```

## Demos

Ship **1-10 input-trace files** under `/workspace/game/demo_outputs/`, one per
demo, each named `*.json`. The evaluator launches a fresh game per trace,
replays your trace as synthetic mouse and keyboard input at 1280x720, and
records the screen. Only the first 10 traces by filename are evaluated;
recordings longer than 20 s are sampled from a random 20 s window.

### Scenarios

Normal play should start from the title screen and demonstrate the task's
core gameplay loop.
Demo playback must be deterministic. For demos that need a specific state
(a specific level, combat state, upgrade screen, result state, or late-game
setup), define named scenarios your game loads when launched with:

```
godot --path /workspace/game -- --scenario <id>
```

When `--scenario <id>` is present the game must skip menus, set up the named
state deterministically (seed any RNG), and begin accepting input immediately.

### Trace file format

```json
{
  "scenario": "title_flow",
  "duration_frames": 360,
  "events": [
    {"frame": 30,  "type": "mouse_click", "button": "left", "x": 300, "y": 360},
    {"frame": 90,  "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "1"},
    {"frame": 180, "type": "key_press",   "keycode": "SPACE"},
    {"frame": 300, "type": "wait"}
  ]
}
```

- `scenario` — optional; omit for a normal game launch from the title screen.
- `duration_frames` — total frames to record at 30 fps; cap at **600 (20 s)**.
- `events` — time-ordered inputs. Coordinates are pixels in the 1280x720
  viewport. Supported types:
  - `mouse_click`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}`
  - `mouse_down` / `mouse_up`: `{frame, type, button: "left"|"right", x, y}` —
    use these for drag interactions: emit `mouse_down` at the start point,
    one or more `mouse_move` events along the way, and `mouse_up` at the end.
    A `mouse_click` is a `mouse_down` + `mouse_up` at the same point in tight
    succession.
  - `mouse_move`: `{frame, type, x, y}`
  - `key_press` / `key_down` / `key_up`: `{frame, type, keycode}` — keycodes:
    `A`-`Z`, `0`-`9`, `ESCAPE`, `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `TAB`, `BACKSPACE`,
    `DELETE`, `SHIFT`, `CTRL`, `ALT`, `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.
  - `wait`: `{frame, type}` — anchor frame, no input.

Replay must be deterministic: same trace, fresh launch, same outcome every time.
